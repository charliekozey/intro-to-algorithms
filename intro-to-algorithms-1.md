# what is an algorithm?
- a series of steps to accomplish a task
- analogy: recipe
- example: long division
  
# what is codewars?
- sign up
- demo

# understand the problem
- example: codewars "check for factor"
- inputs + their data types
- outputs + their data types
- constraints
- build test cases
- edge cases!
 
# decide on the steps
- draw a picture/chart
- break into smaller problems
- pseudocode
- list your tools

# how to practice
- think about the edge of your ability:

![zone of proximal development](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.dJpBgtg9kK-QTIx8hhnkHgHaFG%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=d6f0874f4da56e7996c0e060b9ad92ce86095368424bcef9d820cd2b38e3e33a&ipo=images)

- if well inside the edge (fully in the green circle):
	- drill for speed
	- refactor: efficiency, readability
- if just inside the edge (border of green circle/overlap):
	- work it out on your own
- if just outside the edge (overlap/border of yellow circle):
	1. think about how you might solve it, pseudocode
		- don't bang your head against a wall
	2.  look up tutorial
	3.  research anything unfamiliar 
	4.  complete it, understand solution
	5.  review the next day
